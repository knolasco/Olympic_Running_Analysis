# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to practice web scraping using Beautiful Soup and to determine how competitive the Olympic games have become over time. We will be collecting data from [Olympedia.org](http://www.olympedia.org/) which contains data for all olympic events for each year they were present. We will be focusing on running events for men and women and seeing how the top three times change over time.
